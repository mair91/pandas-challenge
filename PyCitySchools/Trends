TRENDS

1. Student’s performance levels are relatively constant across grades by School, which can point out that a student’s grade is not necessarily a variable that affects his/her performance or that should be used as a factor to be considered in efforts to boost students’ results.

2. In general, Charter schools’ students perform better than Public school’s students; Charter school’s students have a specially better performance in the Math test. 

3. Performance by students in schools with more than 2,000 students is significantly worse than the smaller schools; school’s size is particularly significant in Math scores. 

4. School’s budget per student has an inversely relation with  students’ overall passing percentage and with both Math and Reading passing percentage.
